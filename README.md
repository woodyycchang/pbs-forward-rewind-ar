# About the Project  
Forward Rewind is a team effort aimed at creating a web app that brings history to life using AR technology. Our goal is to make learning about history not only informative but also fun and immersive. The app allows users to explore historical landmarks and events as if they were physically present, providing contextual information, interactive elements, and multimedia content.

The collaboration with PBS Wisconsin ensures that the content is accurate, educational, and accessible to users of all ages.

# Features

# What works
The current code entirely works. It covers all pointers mentioned in 'Usage' section above.

# What does not work
Search tab is not functional right now. The expectation is to have a feature for user to search locations and read interesting stories  about them. The scope for this feature is open.

# Next steps
- Gather more storytelling elements (story audios, transcripts, and models) to cover more tourist destinations so that this app can be widely used.
- Explore more user engagement options such as face recognition to overlay related accessories.
- Host this on a domain owned by PBS Wisconsin. Current domain is being funded by team member Sunghyeok Hwang (shwang98@wisc.edu).
